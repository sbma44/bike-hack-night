# bike hack night presentation

Hello! This is the slide deck for a talk I gave at [Bike Hack Night VI](https://www.meetup.com/Transportation-Techies/events/231755172/). It has a few related repos:

- [bikedatacollector-ios](https://github.com/sbma44/bikedatacollector-ios)
- [bikedatacollctor-python](https://github.com/sbma44/bikedatacollector-python)
- [bikedatacollector-arduino](https://github.com/sbma44/bikedatacollector-arduino)

It's worth noting that much of the signal analysis for this project wound up in _this_ repo, thanks to the flexibility of HTML5 for exploratory work and the excellent turf.js library. The Python doesn't do much except grab data from Firebase.

Don't hesitate to open an issue or otherwise get in touch if you want to adapt this to your own use! It may get cleaned up in the future as I finish the project (but then again it might not).
